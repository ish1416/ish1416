## Engineering Philosophy

**Build for production.** Every application should be deployment-ready from day one. Write code with error handling, logging, and monitoring in mind.

**Optimize for scale.** Design systems that handle 10x growth without architectural rewrites. Think about concurrency, caching, and database performance from the start.

**Automate relentlessly.** Manual processes are technical debt. Invest in automation, testing pipelines, and CI/CD from the beginning.

**Code is communication.** Write for humans first, machines second. Prioritize readability, documentation, and maintainability over clever abstractions.

**Ship iteratively.** Perfect is the enemy of done. Build MVPs, gather feedback, and iterate based on real user needs rather than assumptions.
